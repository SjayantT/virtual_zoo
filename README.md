# virtual_zoo
Hello this is my first project in web-development and uploading it on github for first time. <br>
I started working on this project from 30 April 2024. In this day a "WEBMANIA" was organized by our college which is BBAU Lucknow (A Central University). <br>
I get a project on 'Virtual Zoo' topic. <br>
In it we take a registrtion of user before entering in our website then the next process is login process. when the user fill all the details correctly then the user can enter 
in the website.
<br>
The first webpage is about the animan in short term. After clicking on that animal's about link the user will visit in the next webpage , then he/she can read about that 
animal in dept and can watch images of that animal. <br>
We can make changes in our project time to time.
